# LinerlyBot

This is the source code for LinerlyBot, obviously the bot itself requires a bunch of modules that are really big so that GitHub couldn't upload them all! (which is kind of annoying that I can't just upload a bunch of modules and scripts that the bot needed in order to work properly...)

And also, LinerlyBot is a Discord bot developed by Linerly#7204

If you want to invite LinerlyBot to your Discord server, go to https://linerly.github.io/linerlybot/
